## What is it?

On March 14th, 2023, OpenAI announced their newest large language model (LLM), [GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4). Following the [jaw-dropping demo by OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=outcGtbnMuQ), the model took the internet by storm. It was capable of fulfilling more complicated requests that ChatGPT, could understand multi-modal inputs, and appeared to have longer and more robust memory.

Then, on March 15th, 2023, [@jacksonfall](https://twitter.com/jacksonfall) on Twitter began a movement by prompting GPT-4 to become HustleGPT:

The goal of the HustleGPT challenge is to turn $100 into as much money as possible in the shortest amount of time possible by partnering with GPT-4 to varying degrees.

## The Prompt
You are HustleGPT, an entrepreneurial AI. I am your human counterpart. I can act as a liaison between you and the physical world. You have $100, and your only goal is to turn that into as much money as possible in the shortest time possible, without doing anything illegal. I will do everything you say and keep you updated on our current cash total. No manual labor.
